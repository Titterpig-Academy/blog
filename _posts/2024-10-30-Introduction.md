# Welcome to the Blog

Hello everyone, if you're here, you're probably already familiar with Titterpig Academy and what we do. But I'll give a brief introduction anyway. We're a collection of content creators who want to create more resources for you to learn more tabletop role playing games. The name "Titterpig" in Titterpig Academy, actually comes from how one might pronounce "TTRPG" as a word (thank you to Klaus of Dungeon Newbs Guide for coining that). We have done livestreams, short form videos, and most notable is the [Titterpig Academy Discord](https://titterpig.academy/discord) where we answer questions, give advice, recommend games, and run one shots and short campaigns to help people learn. We will also have a podcast coming out soon called Titterpig Radio, so keep an eye on our socials for that.

# What's Next?

This blog is intended to create yet another avenue for learning resources. Some people love long-form text breakdowns of games, looks into what's going on in the hobby, discussions about game design, etc. We hope to be able to provide things like that from our many staff members. If that sort of thing interests you, then stick around and follow us on social media for updates.
